worth 30% of CA, 10% questions we give to others and 10% how we answer questions. -> 50% OVERALL

Need to consider all corpi

TASK: find paraphrases, and score them via labels.

Labels subject to criticality -> created my humans.

'trial' file -> what sentences used, build own models here

'train' -> exploit dataset

trial contains some errors, and usually contained in train.

test contains no labels.

We won't have access to trial set, only train and test -> considering our labs as the "trial"

Will need to provide analysis + scores for 2nd point of 5th slide

NOTHING USED AFTER 2012!!!! No embeddings, no BERC, etc....

can use spacy but not word embeddings

Conclusion + analysis for all.

no pdf report is needed, just slides -> for presentation.

will be a big notebook file, will need to split.

result benchmarks on slide 6. --> theres no way we will get below baseline as "it's quite stupid"

Have to come to other presentations and ask questions to get marks for this!!!

10/10 overall not possible in project (???)

easy to get 10/10 in analysis for project -> "copy the papers" (????)

most groups get 9 or better (from slide 6)

1 or 2 good quality question is good per person

slide 7 -> test models.

"Task 6 Results" -> bottom of report, table with model and what techniques used. USE THIS FOR CANDIDATES
