This leads to a higher similarity score across all of the preprocessing testcases that were conducted.\n","\n","We also want to highlight how, despite the fact that the library usually gives us lemmas in lowercase, differences can be observed when comparing the distances after converting to lowercase or not. This is because when the library detects that the word corresponds to a proper noun, the lemma is returned with the first letter capitalized. This can cause differences when it is detected as a proper noun in one sentence but not in the other."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Qe5SC6fU5t2Z"},"source":["# Comparison of Pearson Correlations\n","\n","### Pearson correlation between gold values and Jaccard distances using words from Lab 2 (to 6 decimal places):\n","- Pearson correlation for raw sentences: 0.450498\n","- Pearson correlation for sentences in lower case: 0.462495\n","- Pearson correlation for sentences in lower case without stop words: 0.445160\n","- Pearson correlation for sentences in lower case without punctuation signs: 0.458716\n","\n","\n","### Pearson correlation between gold values and Jaccard distances using lemmas (to 6 decimal places):\n","- Pearson correlation for raw sentences (lemmatized): 0.476777\n","- Pearson correlation for sentences in lower case (lemmatized): 0.481508\n","- Pearson correlation for sentences in lower case without stop words (lemmatized): 0.495948\n","- Pearson correlation for sentences in lower case without punctuation signs (lemmatized): 0.499157\n","\n","\n","To visualise the difference between using words and lemmas, let's use a table to compare test results between the two:\n","\n","| Preprocessing Step | Using Words| Using Lemmas | Difference (%) |\n","|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|---|\n","| Raw Sentences | 0.450498 | 0.476777  | 5.83% similarity increase using lemmas |\n","| Lower Case | 0.462495  | 0.481508  | 4.11% similarity increase using lemmas |\n","| Lower Case + No Stopwords | 0.445160  | 0.495948  | 11.41% similarity increase using lemmas |\n","| Lower Case + No Punctuation | 0.458716  | 0.499157 | 8.82% similarity increase using lemmas |\n","\n","In all 4 test cases we performed from last week, using lemmas instead of words led to a increase in the Pearson correlation between the gold standard and the Jaccard similarity for each sentence pair.

Lemmatization cannot be performed on these words, so the token form of the word was used instead. The words were not removed to maintain the integrity and context of the sentences. Removing them could have led to information loss which could skew the similarity scores.\n","\n","\n","# Conclusions\n","The results from this lab exercise show that lemmatization consistently improves the accuracy of sentence similarity when compared to using raw word forms.\n","\n","This conclusion was expected, as words with the same lemma usually have similar meanings.

Across each of the preprocessing testcases we performed, we observed an increase in the Pearson correlation between the Jaccard distance and the gold standard using lemmas instead of words. This suggests that lemmatization is useful in aligning word forms that would otherwise be treated as distinct tokens (e.g.: \"swimming\" and \"swim\").\n","\n","### Q5b) Do you think that could perform better for any pair of texts?\n","Generally lemmatization improves text similarity tasks, but there are scenarios where using the non-lemmatized form of the word might lead to better performance. For example, if two sentences / texts contain terms that have different meanings in different forms (e.g.: \"run\" as in running vs \"run\" as in a stock market run), lemmatizing would increase similarity and lead to an incorrect reduction in Jaccard distance.\n","\n","For instance, we can have two sentences with totally different meanings (the similarity should be as low as possible) but containing words that, despite being different, share the same lemma:\n","\n","*   \"The last show from Cirque du Soleil looks great\"\n","*   \"John is finally showing his paintings at the museum\"\n","\n","Lemmatization is also harmful when the structure and style of the sentence / document is relevant as the information is lost. For example, consider the following sentences \"I bought apples\", and \"I buy apples\". After lemmatization their Jaccard similarity would be 1, suggesting that the sentences are identical even though they convey different meanings.\n","\n","You can see in the next cell how these two sentences have a Jaccard similarity of 0.059 when using the surface words, whereas using lemmas, the Jaccard similarity increases to 0.125. This is due to \"show\" and \"showing,\" which have different meanings but share the same lemma.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":297,"status":"ok","timestamp":1727889357431,"user":{"displayName":"Pablo Blanco Del Prado","userId":"02913114842217546842"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"xaGX0K-Fz68f","outputId":"9b02c3fb-642d-401e-ccf6-2166c02bbd5c"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Lemmas:  ['the', 'last', 'show', 'from', 'cirque', 'du', 'soleil', 'look', 'great'] / ['john', 'be', 'finally', 'show', 'his', 'painting', 'at', 'the', 'museum']\n","l1 ['john', 'be', 'finally', 'show', 'his', 'painting', 'at', 'the', 'museum']\n","Words ['the', 'last', 'show', 'from', 'cirque', 'du', 'soleil', 'looks', 'great'] / ['john', 'is', 'finally', 'showing', 'his', 'paintings', 'at', 'the', 'museum']\n","Words similarity: 0.05882352941176472\n","Lemmas similarity: 0.125\n"]},{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package punkt to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package punkt is already up-to-date!\n"]}],"source":["import nltk\n","nltk.download('punkt')\n","\n","# Test sentences\n","sentence0 = \"The last show from Cirque du Soleil looks great\"\n","sentence1 = \"John is finally showing his paintings at the museum\"\n","\n","# Lemmas\n","doc0 = nlp(sentence0)\n","doc1 = nlp(sentence1)\n","lemma0 = [token.lemma_.lower() for token in doc0 ]\n","lemma1 = [token.lemma_.lower() for token in doc1 ]\n","\n","# Words\n","st0 = nltk.word_tokenize(sentence0)\n","st1 = nltk.word_tokenize(sentence1)\n","word0 = [w.lower() for w in st0 ]\n","word1 = [w.lower() for w in st1 ]\n","\n","# Jacc similarity\n","jac_lemmas = 1 - jaccard_distance(set(lemma0), set(lemma1))\n","jac_words = 1 - jaccard_distance(set(word0), set(word1))\n","\n","print(\"Lemmas: \", lemma0, \"/\", lemma1)\n","print(\"l1\", lemma1)\n","print(\"Words\", word0, \"/\", word1)\n","print(\"Words similarity:\", jac_words)\n","print(\"Lemmas similarity:\", jac_lemmas)\n","\n"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
