Initially, we tokenized the text directly with Punkt tokenizer, which showed that the correlation exists but has a poor result. Since the method behind the gold standard's creation wasn't explained, we have tried to preprocess the sentences to improve the results. These included converting all text to lowercase, removing stop words, and removing punctuation. In each subsequent test, we built on the previous test result that yielded the highest correlation.\n","\n","It should also be noted that gold standard values range from 0 to 5 while Jaccard distance ranges from 0 to 1. While the scales differ, it does not affect the correlation between the two variables therefore we decided against normalizing.\n","\n","\n","# Conclusions\n","In the 4 cases we have tested, we have been able to verify that there is indeed some correlation between the gold standard and the Jaccard distance. However, the results are modest, around 0.45, indicating that there is a certain degree of correlation but not a high degree of correlation.\n","\n","Lowercasing the text improved the results slightly, because it reduces the number of variations in the union and increases overlaps in similar phrases (e.g.: 'The leaders...' and 'Leaders...'). However, removing stop words worsened the results, and removing punctuation led to a minor improvement. We believe this inconsistency is created due to the gold standard potentially using more advanced NLP techniques such as analyzing sentence structure and synonym usage, while Jaccard distance simply measures the percentage of matching words.\n","\n","**Main Conclusion**\n","The Jaccard distance, based on percentage of matching words, is too simplistic to reliably gauge sentence
