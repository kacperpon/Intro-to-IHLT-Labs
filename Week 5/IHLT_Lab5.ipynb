performance.\n","\n","Besides this, in all the groups except Lin, the differences for the third group are lower or equal than 1 and 3, as expected. For Lin, boy/woman is more similar than boy/girl, which we find incoherent.\n","\n","Finally, it's outstanding how in the case of Wu-Palmer, all the pairs in each group have exactly the same similarity. We expected that the third group would have less similarity than the other two, but the results have turned out to be the same.\n","\n","With all these results we can conclude that, for our four words, the best metric is Wu-Palmer.\n","\n","It's important to note that these results are not extrapolable to the entire language corpus. We have used only 4 words of one category, which is not statistically significant.\n","\n","Finally, we have learnt how important is to use the right synsets when comparing words. This means that, when developing an automatic tool it's important how to choose the right synsets - using the most common is not enough.\n","\n","Hopefully we will learn more complex skills in the course to select the synsets based on the context or other more suitable criteria."],"metadata":{"id":"qPVkBHN4gUf9"}}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"1u47z-JpOKyxBsNfctfxxJIe9TymRDaIc","timestamp":1729097196279}]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":".venv","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.12.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
