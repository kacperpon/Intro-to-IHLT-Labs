But when using lemmas, the best results were obtained when the punctuation was removed after lowercasing.\n","\n","In this exercise we are required to do a similar study but using synsets after disambiguating words instead of words or lemmas. Given our reference value is 0.499157 which was achieved using lemmas after applying lowercasing and removing punctuation, this steps aims to further refine word sense disambiguation. Similar to how lemmatisation led to improved scores compared to raw word tokens, we anticipate that incorporating word sense information will yield better results than the previously stated reference value.\n","\n","On a final note: when disambiguating with Lesk, we will get word senses for the 4 open-class categories only. This means a significant portion of words will be removed from the sentences. To be able to analyze the impact of this words, we will compute the Jaccard distances and correlation by using only the open-class categories and also including the lemmas of the words belonging to the rest of categories.\n","\n","It is worth mentioning that our intention was to disambiguate the words using Lesk and UKB. Unfortunately, we have not been able to complete the results of UKB due to the TextServer instability or quota limits.

Senses | 0.423957 | **0.413353**  |\n","| Senses + Lemmas | 0.457442  | **0.412781** |\n","\n","The first evident conclusion is that our hypothesis stating that the use of senses should perform better than using lemmas (or words) was incorrect. The mean Jaccard similarities are lower than those obtained by words and lemmas.\n","The decrease in correlation is noteworthy, especially since it performed worse than even the most basic word comparison methods.\n","\n","From these results, we can conclude that Lesk performs poorly at disambiguating words. We can visualise this poor performance by further analysis: the output of Lesk. In the next cell we can see each sentence and the synsets assigned.\n","\n","It is not difficult to find poor disambiguation. For instance:\n","\n","------\n","Sentence 1: Let me remind you that our allies include fervent supporters of this tax.\n","\n","tax -> **tax.v.02** : set or determine the amount of (a payment such as a fine)\n","\n","Sentence 2: I want to remind you that of our allies, it is of major of tax.\n","major -> major.v.01 : have as one's principal field of study\n","\n","tax -> **tax.v.03** : use to the limit\n","\n","------\n","In the above sentences, tax should have the same meaning, but Lesk is assigning different senses. Words or lemmas would count the words as positive match.\n","\n","Another example:\n","\n","------\n","Sentence 1: The leaders have now been given a new chance and let us hope they seize it.\n","\n","have -> **have.v.07** : have a personal or business relationship with someone\n","\n","Sentence 2: The leaders now have another chance to let them and therefore seize it.\n","\n","have -> **take.v.35** : have sex with; archaic use\n","\n","------\n","\n","Once again, the same problem is evident. The word 'have' (no comments about the hilarious meaning assigned in one of the sentences...).\n","\n","In this same pair of sentences we can see how an incorrect meaning is assigned to \"it\". Besides that, it has no negative impact as the same wrong meaning is assigned in both sentences:\n","\n","it -> information_technology.n.01 : the branch of engineering that deals with the use of computers and telecommunications to retrieve and store and transmit information.\n","\n","We can therefore conclude that the results have worsened due to Lesk's poor performance for the assigned task.
